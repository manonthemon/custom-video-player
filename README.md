## Description

In this challenge I worked with JS to tweak the HTML5 built in video player. Using JS functions, I added the following functionality:

<li>Dynamically updating pause and play button </li>
<li>Volume and progress sliders </li>
<li>Progress bar with scrubbing functionality</li><br>

Working on this project helped me in better understaind of:
<li>Event listeners </li>
<li>Query selectors </li>
<li>For each loops </li>
<li>Functions </li><br>
